# CP365 portfolio

Mario Agent: Passes level 0. Maybe level 1.

Searh_Astar:  DFS, BFS, IDS, and A* bots can all take a 3x3 board (run SlidingPuzzle with no args).

Genetic Algorithm: immitates the picture quite decently in under 1000 generations.

Othello bot: pretty stupid tbh, didn't win anything (may make some good moves sometimes though).

Linear regression:does OK,  dv = DJIA numbers, iv = avg temp/high temp.

ANN: 1 hidden layer, seems to work OK, reports around 96-97%, does breast cancer dataset + knows a good glass of white when it sees one.

Clustering: seems to cluster correctly, takes a minute or so to print clusters.
